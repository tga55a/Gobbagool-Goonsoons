Project Overview:
->This project puts a creative spin on the hit game Cookie Clicker. We took the foundations of that game and transformed it into something beautiful. 
->Gobbagool Goonsoons the Italian brainrot based clicking game!
->How the game works is you click the large gobbagool in the center of the page also known as the gob. Clicking the gobbagool adds gobs to your bank.
->You use the gobs in your bank to buy various characters. When you buy a character it allows you to start adding gobs to your bank without clicking also known as gobs per second.
->Each character has a different cost and a different base amount it adds to your gobs per second.
->As you buy more of a character the cost for that character increases. As you buy more characters the amount of gobs you make per click increases as well.
->The ultimate goal of the game is to get to 1 Billion gobs unlocking the legendary Gobbagool Goonsoon character which makes 1 Billion gobs per second.

Extra features:
-> After about 10 seconds you can look at the bottom of the page to see a small animation of one of the characters
-> At the top of the page there is a help video that explains how the game works.
